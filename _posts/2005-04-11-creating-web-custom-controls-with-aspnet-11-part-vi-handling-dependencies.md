title: Creating Web Custom Controls With ASP.Net 1.1 - Part VI - Handling Dependencies
date: 2005-04-11 03:30:00 +10:00

The main purpose of creating controls is so they can be reused in other projects. The beauty of Web Custom Controls as opposed to Web User Controls is that they are compiled into an assembly which can easily be copied between ASP.Net projects. 

When I am creating controls, I always have dependencies to support the them. At the very least, I have JavaScript that needs to be rendered for client-side behaviours of the control. I have written several controls that also rely on style-sheets and images to be used with the control. Deployment of these dependencies becomes more than a little nightmare.

Take an image for example. What happens when a control needs to render an image to the browser? It needs to render some HTML like &lt;IMG src= 'test.gif' /&gt;. The browser then makes a request to the web server for test.gif. Thats all very well and good, but to deploy this control, you not only need to copy the controls assembly to the deployment bin folder, but also need to deploy test.gif to the correct folder to be requested by the browser. Each dependency of the control needs to be copied across each of the ASP.Net projects that use the control. This very quickly becomes a maintenance problem.

<!--more-->

What we want to do is package all of these dependencies into the controls assembly. To achieve this, move the required files from the ASP.Net project and put them in the controls project. For each of these files, go to the property grid and set their Build Action to Embedded Resource. This will add each file as a resource to the controls assembly when it is compiled. We have now solved the deployment problem for the dependencies of the controls. When the controls assembly is copied for use in another project, all the dependencies are deployed with it as they are all bundled in the one dll file. 

The next question that should be ringing around your head is how do these decencies get requested and rendered to the browser? Here is where our friend IHttpHandler comes into play. When a class implements the IHttpHandler interface, it is forced to support the ProcessRequest method. The code in this method can determine the resource being requested by the browser and take appropriate action. In the case of our dependencies, we will determine which resource is requested, extract it from the assembly and then render it to the browser.

Using IHttpHandler is perfect for covering our dependency deployment problems, but there is a just a little configuration that needs to be done in the web site to get it working. The web.config file allows us to specify a page/url reference that will cause our IHttpHandler to be called into action. This configuration causes the server to call our IHttpHandler implementing class when a specific url is requested. Just in case you are a little confused about this, the page requested doesn't actually exist, but the browser can still request it. When this happens, instead of returning a 404 error, ASP.Net hijacks the request and passes it on to the handler.

This is what is required in the web.config file:

```xml
<configuration >
    <system.web >
        <httpHandlers >
            <add  verb ="*"  path ="MyDev.Web.Controls.aspx"  type ="MyDev.Web.Controls.ResHandler,MyDev.Web.Controls" />
        </httpHandlers >
    </system.web >
</configuration >
```

We have now been able to hook up a web request to call the IHttpHandler interface in a specific class and assembly. Now when the request comes through, we need to identify which resource in the assembly is being requested.When I was originally researching this, I came across an article by [Eric Woodruff][0] that had a great idea for not only identifying the resource requested, but also supporting a caching flag. It will be through querystrings that the handler will be told what resource is being requested.

In the previous article, I discussed the best ways of rendering scripts for a control. Most control developers render the script directly to the page either when the page starts rendering, or when the page finishes rendering or when the control renders. As discussed, these scripts can be pulled out of the assembly for easier development, but rendering the script directly in the page doesn't allow for any caching of the data. With this method, a control could render a script tag that looks like <code>&lt;SCRIPT type='text/javascript' src='MyDev.Web.Controls.aspx?Res=MyControlScript.js' /&gt;</code>. This causes the browser to make a separate request for the script which can now be cached by the browser. The result is that the pages will load much faster.

I created a class that implements IHttpHandler and added as many helpful features as I could think of. It will handle text and binary resources and make its best determination as to the content-type of the resource. It also supports some useful methods for registering resources with a page. As this class deals with reflection, assemblies and resources, I have cached objects and data that are often referenced and minimised the number of times the same method is called when processing the resources. Let me know if you find more improvements that can be made.
