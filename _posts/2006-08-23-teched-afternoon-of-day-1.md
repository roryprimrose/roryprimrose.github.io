This afternoon I was going to go to a WF session, but I bailed so that I could spend some time on my session, making sure that the demos were going to behave themselves.

Oh, forgot to mention. I got to meet [Berno][2] this morning which was really good.

In the evening, Chris and I were a little late to 'Ask the experts' because we were able to get access to the room we will give our session in. It was helpful to be able to see the room and check that the VPC works from the main VPC server using my laptop as the client. The Connected Systems area of 'Ask the experts' was a little quiet which is unfortunate, but other areas seemed to get a lot of people asking questions.
