I just saw [Dave saying his bit][0] about representation of geeks in movies and TV. Overall, I think geeks get displayed in a way that is very unlike the majority of the geek population. While I agree with Dave, I think that some of the ideas in movies can also be the kind of things that geeks will want to use or build, no matter how impractical they are or difficult they would be to get. 

Two things spring immediately to mind. The cool data searching tool used in Minority Report and the GUI compiler in Swordfish. While the GUI compiler offers no benefit at all, I just can't go past a great UI no matter what it does or doesn't do.

What's your favorite piece of fictional movie/TV software?
