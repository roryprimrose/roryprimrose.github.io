This is another one of those memory (as in I want to keep some kind of reference to this post) type of posts. I had previous come across the [Activator.CreateInstance and beyond][0] post by [Haibo Luo][1] about the performance of Activator.CreateInstance, but had since forgotten about it. Now it's here to stay [:)].
