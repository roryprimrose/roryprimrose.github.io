I have been working on a winforms wizard framework for a while when I get the chance. My aim with this project is to be able to create a reusable framework for wizard style dialogs and pages for the 2.0 .Net framework.

The first RC version of my [WizardUI] has been released on [CodePlex]. I would appreciate any comments. You can find the release [here][0].
