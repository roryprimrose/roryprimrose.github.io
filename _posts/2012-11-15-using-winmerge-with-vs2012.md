My [Using WinMerge with TFS][0] post has to be consistently the most viewed post on this site. I have finally been able to get around to posting updated reg files to support VS2012 on both x86 and x64 platforms (see the bottom of that post for the links). These reg files will configure VS2012 to use Winmerge for TFS diff/merge operations (no Visual Studio restart is required).

Enjoy
