There have been several times when I have needed to process a string that contains a set of arguments. It always seems to be a lot of work splitting up arguments by using white space as a delimiter because you need to take into account white space that is surrounded by brackets. 

Just for kicks, I tried to come up with a regular expression that would do just that. Here is the result.

```text
[^\s"]*"[^"]*"[^\s"]*|[^\s"]+
```
