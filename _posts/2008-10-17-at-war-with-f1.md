 After implementing the [double F1 solution][0] a few moths ago, I now get continuously bitten by the change. I keep pressing F1 just once and then wait for help to come up only to remember that I need to hit F1 a second time. It probably doesn&#39;t help that MSDN from Visual Studio takes a long time to come up the first time, but eventually I realise that I need to hit F1 a second time. 

 It&#39;s a war between my automated single F1 press for help vs my misfiring over from the ESC key. I will keep the setting how it is though. Forgetting the second F1 press isn&#39;t as bad as accidentally hitting F1 instead of ESC.
