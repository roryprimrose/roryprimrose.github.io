title: SSAS fails to process TFS cube in Tfs_Analysis

One of the TFS instances that I am responsible for started failing to process its Analysis Services cube a few days ago. The nature of the environment is that I can only do a reboot after hours. I also wanted to try to find out what was wrong before resorting to a reboot so that we could try to fix the problem rather than just doing a band-aid.  

The topology of the TFS deployment is the following:  

* TFS App Tier – also hosts SSRS
* TFS Data Tier – SQL Server, SSIS and SSAS
* TFS SharePoint Tier
* TFS Controllers
* TFS Build Environment
* CI Host Platform

Each of the services use domain accounts that are unique to each service.   

The primary problem was that the 2 hourly job to reprocess the Tfs_Analysis SSAS cube from the Tfs_Warehouse database failed because SSAS could not connect to the SQL Server data engine. The following is most of the exception detail of the failure.

These two services are running on the same local VM and are each responding to other remote requests. TFS still works for WIT and source control, SSAS still responds to report requests. Weirdly, SQL Profiler was showing activity on SQL Server when attempting to process the cube. Perhaps only part of the processing could get a connection to SQL Server whereas a later part of the process could not.

Some search results were indicating that it might be a problem with a loopback address. The datasource in Tfs_Analysis was using the CNAME for the data tier to point to the local box so this might be a contributing factor. This did seem unlikely though given that this TFS instance has worked fine for months. We changed the data source to several combinations (localhost, (local) and .) but the cube processing continued to fail. To rule out a DNS problem, we also tried the data source with the local IP address of 127.0.0.1 with no joy.

The configuration of the data source in SSAS uses impersonation to connect to SQL Server rather than the service account of SSAS. Just for kicks, we added the SSAS service account as a local admin on the VM. We then got a different error. Processing the cube then failed because of a login timeout rather than a connectivity problem.

We then removed impersonation and added the SSAS service account as a warehouse reader in Tfs_Warehouse. Processing the cube could now get an authenticated connection to SQL Server, but it then failed because of schema issues. The cube was trying to reference columns in a Tfs_Warehouse view that did not exist.

There were no answers after several days of trying to resolve this issue without a reboot. The problems being experienced also did not make any sense.

A reboot fixed all these problems last night. SSAS can now connect to SQL Server using its original configuration and can successfully process the cube. It’s frustrating that several days were lost and there are no answers other than a band-aid. On the positive side however, the problem has been resolved.
