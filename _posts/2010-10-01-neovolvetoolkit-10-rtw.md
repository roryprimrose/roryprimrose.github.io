I have finally marked my Neovolve.Toolkit project as stable for version 1.0. It includes the recent work I have done for WF4. The toolkit comes with the binaries, a chm help file for documentation information and xml comment files for intellisense in Visual Studio. 

You can [download the toolkit][0] from the project on Codeplex.

The following tables outline the types available in the namespaces across the toolkit assemblies. The information here is copied from the compiled help file.
