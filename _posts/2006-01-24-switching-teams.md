I'll let you in on a little secret of mine. I quietly enjoy the VB vs. C# language flame wars. 

Mostly I think it is a bit ridiculous how passionately and personally people take this 'mine is better than yours' argument. As I don't take it as a personal argument, I think most peoples behavior in this arena is a lot like a comedy sitcom. You watch it, laugh at it and then change channels.

I have enjoyed working and playing with VB since 1998 (about 1990 if you include a little dabbling in GW Basic). I find VB really easy to read and very forgiving for a typist that doesn't have 100% typing accuracy. Having been often restricted by VB5 and VB6 capabilities compared to C++, I have really enjoyed the advances made in VB.Net.

That being said, as much as I enjoy VB, I have now started to spread my wings into C#. I have been able to follow C# without a problem, but haven't really spent any solid time developing in it. I see this as a disadvantage and probably a hindrance to my career. There is really not much difference between the two, but being fluent in both is a definite advantage.

Now it's out there, all you C# junkies can enjoy this small win in your flame war.
