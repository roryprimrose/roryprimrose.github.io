Visual Studio has this really nice setup page when you first run it after install where it asks you what kind of development environment you are familiar with, such as VB, C++, General etc etc. This is really cool, but not so cool when you pick the wrong one. Anyone know how to get prompted with this page again? There are no obvious registry entries that I can tweak.

Hey, don't bother answering. I just figured it out. The import/export settings dialog allows you to reset the IDE to one of those values. Go to Tools -&gt; Import and Export Settings -&gt; Reset all settings -&gt; No, just reset settings, overwriting my current settings and then select the IDE style you want.
