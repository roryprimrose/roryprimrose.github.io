title: Configuring a TFS 2010 build agent to compile SharePoint 2010 projects

Iâ€™ve been doing several TFS consulting gigs over the last couple of years. The one thing that keeps popping up is the requirement to build several types of platforms using TeamBuild/TFSBuild. My preference is to isolate build agents and their customisations. This means for example that I have a mix of build agents like the following:

* Standard (full VS install + any common additions - WiX for example)
* SharePoint
* BizTalk

Tagging the build agents and configuring the build definitions for those tags then allows the build to be directed to the correct build agent.

<!--more-->

The next consideration is that the customisations to the build agent will ideally contain just what is required to build solutions and run unit tests. A SharePoint build agent for example should not have a full SharePoint installed on it. Instead it can just have the required assembly dependencies registered on it to allow the build to succeed.

There is a PowerShell script floating around that assists in harvesting SharePoint assemblies from a development server to then install and configure them on the SharePoint build agent. The original script was published by Microsoft (see [here][0]) and subsequently updated by the [SharePoint Developer Team][1] to include additional assemblies. The later post also provides a great walkthrough for creating SharePoint build definitions.

We are finding in my current consultation that the client is referencing even more assemblies. Complicating the matter is that several of the assemblies exist in the GAC as both x86 and x64. The PowerShell script does not handle this case and throws an error.

I have updated the PowerShell script to include the following changes:

* Renders all matching files when multiple files match the file name (used to then retarget the included files, see next point)
* Allowed full file paths to be included (including GAC paths in order to specify a particular GAC entry)
* Skipped harvesting files that have already been harvested
   * Includes skipping the recursive searching for a filename which was the slowest part of the script
* Added defensive code for updating the registry to point to installed assemblies (previous script threw an error if the registry key already existed)

Here is my version of the SharePoint harvest script.

# This script collects and installs the files required to build SharePoint
# projects on a TFS build server. It supports both TFS 2010 and TFS 2008.
#
# Step 1. Run the script on a developer machine where VS 2010 and SP 2010 are installed.
#         Use the "-Collect" parameter to collect files required for installation.
#
# Step 2. Copy the script and folder of collected files to a TFS build server.
#         Use the "-Install" parameter to install the files.
