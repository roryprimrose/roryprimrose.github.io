Late last week I putting together another VPC build for my [TechEd session][0]. I had XP installed and fully patched, a minimal VS2005 up and running and the minimum WinFX Beta 2 bits thrown in. After a couple of hours installing the software on my base VPC XP drive I had finally got the build I needed for the session.

I wanted to move the VPC machine settings file to the same location as its hard drive (I stuffed up the original directory paths). After I moved the settings file, I double clicked it to make sure it would run. 

Yeah... not good. I don't know what happened, or who to blame (other than myself), but both my VPC hard drive and the machine settings files got deleted. Poof! Gone. No more, and not the recycle bin type deleted, where talking the end of the line. The files were no longer on the drive. Stupidly, I didn't think about getting one of those drive utilities to undelete the files. Nope, I took the easy way out and rebuilt the VPC again from my XP base drive. Two hours later, I was again ready for WCF world domination.
