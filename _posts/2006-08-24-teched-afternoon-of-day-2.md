The first session I went to this afternoon was _ASP.NET: End-to-End - Building a Complete Web Application Using ASP.NET 2.0, Visual Studio 2005, and IIS 7 (Part 2)_ by [Scott Guthrie][0]. Like Part 1 before lunch, I really enjoyed this session even though I didn't learn anything new.

The second session I went to was _Visual Basic: Tips, Tricks and Futures_ by [Bill McCarthy][1] and [Geoff Appleby][2]. Bill and Geoff presented some interesting tips and tricks for VB.Net and the IDE (with several of plugs for Bill's projects :) ). I did get a chuckle out of their project working when it was supposed to break and breaking when it was supposed to work. I guess I got off light with only one demo glitch with my session. Hehe, bad luck boys :P.

The last session of the day for me was _Developing Data-Driven Web Applications with .NET Language Integrated Query_ with Scott again. I have heard a lot about LINQ and its derivatives but haven't actually seen it in action. LINQ is some seriously cool stuff. This was obviously a subject that Scott was excited by and enjoyed presenting. I'm looking forward to playing with this in the coming months. 

I did have one question in this session that I didn't get to ask. Scott mentioned that LINQ does delayed execution so that the query is called at the last moment. I was wondering what happens if you then reuse that query. Does it execute again, or is the result cached?

After the sessions were finished for the day, there was the party at the Home nightclub. I was there for a couple of hours, but [like Geoff][3], I'm just not into the nightclub scene.
