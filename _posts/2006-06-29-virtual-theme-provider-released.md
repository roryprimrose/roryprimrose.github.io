 I have been working on a fun project recently. I have put together a VirtualThemeProvider that uses the VirtualPathProvider in the 2.0 framework. 

 The VirtualThemeProvider provides functionality for flexible ASP.Net theme support. It provides the ability to merge theme directories with a global theme directory and theme directory filtering. 

 Full source is provided with this project. I would like to get any feedback, comments and suggestions that you have for this project. If you have any, please visit the forum. 

 I have written an article that provides more detail about this project and how to use it.
